Number 1.
Question - Define Monolithic architecture.
Monolithic architecture is a traditional software design pattern where an entire application is built as a single, self-contained unit, with all components tightly integrated and deployed as a single entity. In this architecture, all the features of the application are packaged together, and the application runs as a single process, usually on a single server.

Number 2.
Question - Explain microservices in your own understanding
Microservices is a modern software architecture pattern that breaks down a large, complex application into a set of smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of each other. Each microservice is focused on a specific business capability and is responsible for performing a single task or function within the larger application.

Number 3.
Question - Which of the backend architecture appeals to you and why?
 Microservices architecture appeals to me because it offers more flexibility, scalability, and fault tolerance than monolithic architecture.

 Number 4.
 Question -  Is Nodejs a multithreaded language?
 Node.js is a single-threaded language because it uses a single thread to handle all the incoming requests and events. 

 Number 5.
 Question - What does REPL stand for?
 REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop.
